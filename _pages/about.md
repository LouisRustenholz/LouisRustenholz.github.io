I am a PhD student at [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/) in
Madrid,
<!-- Spain, in the [CLIP Lab](https://cliplab.org/), -->
co-advised by
[Pedro L√≥pez-Garc√≠a](https://software.imdea.org/people/pedro.lopez/) and [Manuel
Hermenegildo](https://cliplab.org/herme/). Before this, I was a student at
[√âcole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), and did a final year at
the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php).

My research interests lie in **static analysis**, more generally formal methods
and *automated* program analyses, and in particular **abstract interpretation**
and **cost analysis**, from theoretical foundations to applications beyond
verification and safety.

I am currently involved in a project on **automated inference of energy
consumption of programs and systems**, with applications in energy
transparency/audit, energy-aware development, verification and optimisation.
Among others, it builds upon the [ENTRA project](http://entraproject.ruc.dk/)
and analyses designed in the context of
[CiaoPP](https://ciao-lang.org/ciao/build/doc/ciaopp.html/).
My current work focuses on new static cost analysis frameworks, aiming
to support more **fine-grained cost models** (e.g. closer to bare metal,
taking into account low-level properties and communicating with hardware
state abstract domains), as well as handle uniformly multi-paradigm
programs with diverse and **complex control-flows**.

Outside of the current focus of my work, I am more broadly interested in
all aspects of formal methods, programming language research, and
theoretical computer science. I always enjoy learning new maths, and
have loved discovering geometric viewpoints on *a priori* non-geometric
problems at least since my first high school science adventures.

I am also involved in various [outreach activities](/outreach/) of
mathematics and computer science for high school students, as well as on
topics related to climate change, carbon regulations, and the
environmental impact of IT.

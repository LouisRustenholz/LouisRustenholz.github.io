## ðŸš§ Website Under Construction ðŸš§

I am a PhD student at [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/) in
Madrid,
<!-- Spain, in the [CLIP Lab](https://cliplab.org/), -->
co-advised by
[Pedro LÃ³pez-GarcÃ­a](https://software.imdea.org/people/pedro.lopez/) and [Manuel
Hermenegildo](https://cliplab.org/herme/). Before this, I was a student at
[Ã‰cole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), and did a final year at
the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php).

My research interests lie in **static analysis**, more generally formal methods
and *automated* program analyses, and in particular **abstract interpretation**
and **cost analysis**, from theoretical foundations to applications beyond
verification and safety.

I am currently involved in a project on **automated inference of energy
consumption of programs and systems**, with applications in energy
transparency/audit, energy-aware development, verification and optimisation.
Among others, it builds upon the [ENTRA project](http://entraproject.ruc.dk/)
and work performed in the context of
[CiaoPP](https://ciao-lang.org/ciao/build/doc/ciaopp.html/).
My current work focuses on new static cost analysis frameworks, aiming
to take into account more **fine-grained cost models** (e.g. closer to bare
metal, taking into abstract information on hardware state and other low-level
properties), as well as uniformly supporting programs displaying diverse
control-flows.

Outside of this project, I a more broadly interested in (...), and have always
enjoyed (...).

Outside of research, I also enjoy ... (i.e. Animath, and did a few talks w/ the Shift Project on the carbon footprint of IT), ... (climbing...)

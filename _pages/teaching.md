## Undergraduate

#### Oral examinations in Computer Science

I have given oral examinations (colles) in computer science at
Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand ([MP2I](/assets/pdf/Programme_MP2I_2122.pdf), 2021-2022).

___

## High school

#### Outreach

I am involved in various activities of scientific outreach, especially towards high school students.
See the [dedicated page](/outreach/).

#### MOOCs in Mathematics

At √âcole polytechnique, I have co-written and taught (2020-2022) two
MOOCs in mathematics aimed at (very motivated) high school students
and young undergraduates. (Unfortunately, they are now archived.)

+ **Rubik's cube : une introduction aux
  groupes d'automorphismes en g√©om√©trie**
  (*with Nordine Azaiz and √âcole polytechnique's e-learning team*).
  Introduction to group theory via Rubik's Cube-like puzzles.
  Design your own formulas using commutators and conjugation.
  Has been applied successfully to [higher-dimensional cubes](https://superliminal.com/cube/)!

+ **Nombres constructibles : autour de la
  constructibilit√© des polygones r√©guliers**
  (*with Pegah Khayatan, Baptiste Plaquevent, [Diego Izquierdo](https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/diego.izquierdo/) and √âcole polytechnique's e-learning team*).
  Straightedge and compass constructions,
  Gauss-Wantzel theorem and its proof, non-constructible numbers,
  and introduction to other connections between geometry and algebra.


#### Tutoring

I have given online tutoring (√âducation Nationale, 2020) in mathematics to students confined during COVID-19 lockdown,
as well as individual tutoring in computer science and physics at various occasions.

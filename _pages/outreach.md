I am involved in various outreach activities of mathematics and
computer science for high school students, in particular with the
[Animath](#animath) association. More institutional activities are
included in the [teaching](/teaching/) page.

Beyond fun and beauty of science, I am also passionate about
issues connected to carbon norms and regulations, energy, and climate
change, and try to involve myself with associations and working groups
on those topics. Recently, I gave a few talks on environmental impacts
of IT with [The Shifters](https://www.theshifters.org/).

Since 2016, I have been working with
<a href="https://www.animath.fr/">Animath</a>, a non-profit
organisation whose goal is to develop the passion of mathematics for
everyone. Every year, tens of thousands of french and french-speaking
high school students participate to activities organised by Animath:
research workshops, summer camps, meeting with researchers, national
and international competitions, etc.

Among the various activities organised by Animath, I am personally
involved in the following projects.

### French Tournament of Young Mathematicians $$(\mathbb{TFJM}^2)$$

The [French Tournament of Young Mathematicians (TFJM)](http://www.tfjm.org/)
is a competition for high school students inspired from mathematical
research, aiming to stimulate interest in mathematics and its
applications as well as develop scientific thinking, communication
skills and teamwork.
<!--  -->
Participants are given several months to work in teams on open
problems and write their solutions, before writing reviews on that of
other teams.
During the tournaments, the students present their results to a jury
and criticize the work of other teams during a debate.


I chaired the national organisation committee of the TFJM in
2019-2020, have been involved in various scientific and organisational
aspects since 2016, and still regularly participate as member of the
jury.

### International Activities

Animath contributes to the promotion of computer science and
mathematical extracurricular activities in different countries by
providing resources and helping to develop summer schools and
mathematical clubs (see
[Animath International](https://www.animath.fr/international/)
official page).


Since 2021, I have been working with
[Club Imatematiko](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100087162743815)
in Fianarantsoa, Madagascar, which organises math and computer science
activities for high school students during the weekend, as well as
week-long training sessions with talks by researchers and olympic or
research-based competitions.

Before this, I also served as contact point for a programming club in
Rwanda and taught a one-week course in Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso.
